# Stringbenders Guitar Capstone Project Write-Up: Guitar Tab Recommendation System

## Project Overview
**Build a recommendation system that suggests guitar tabs to users based on their musical prefrences, playing level, and favorite artists. Use collaborative filtering or content-based filtering techniques to personalize recommendations.

### Project Title:
**Guitar Tab Recommendation System**

### Project Duration:
**Songs composed within that last 90 years**

### Objectives:
1. **Data Acquisition**:
   - Collect guitar tab data from various sources, including online repositories, user-generated content platforms, and licensed databases.
   - Ensure data quality and integrity by verifying sources, removing duplicates, and handling inconsistencies.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and preprocess the acquired data to make it suitable for analysis and recommendation.
   - Normalize data formats, standardize metadata, and resolve any discrepancies or missing information.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extract relevant features from the guitar tab data, such as song metadata (title, artist, genre), tab content (chords, lyrics), user interactions (ratings, favorites), and user attributes (skill level, preferences).

4. **Data Storage and Management**:
   - Design and implement a scalable and efficient data storage solution to store the guitar tab data and associated metadata.
   - Choose appropriate storage technologies, such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, or data lakes
   - Ensure data security, privacy, and compliance with regulations by implementing access controls and encryption mechanisms.

5. **Data Processing and Analysis**:
   - Develop data processing pipelines to ingest, transform, and analyze guitar tab data in batch or real-time (depeding on if we have enough time)
   - Implement algorithms for content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and other recommendation techniques to generate personalized recommendations for users.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into user behavior, content popularity, and trends, which can inform recommendation strategies and model improvements.

6. **Model Deployment and Integration**:
   - Deploy recommendation models and algorithms into production environments, such as web applications
   - Integrate the recommendation engine with user-facing interfaces, ensuring seamless interaction and responsiveness (potentially in the future).
   - Monitor model performance, latency, and resource utilization to optimize system efficiency and user experience.

7. **Continuous Improvement and Maintenance**:
   - Establish monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect anomalies, data drift, and performance degradation in the recommendation system.
   - Iterate on the recommendation algorithms based on user feedback, usage metrics.
   - Maintain data pipelines, infrastructure, and documentation to support ongoing development, scaling, and maintenance of the recommendation system.

## Steps/Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Acquisition**:
   - Web Scraping Tools (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Scrapy) for extracting guitar tab data from online sources.
   - APIs for accessing data from online repositories and platforms (e.g., GitHub API, Ultimate Guitar API).
   - Data Integration Tools (e.g., Apache Nifi) for aggregating data from multiple sources.

2. **Data Storage and Management**:
   - Relational Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for storing structured data such as user profiles, song metadata, and user interactions.
   - NoSQL Databases (e.g., MongoDB, Redis) for storing unstructured or semi-structured data, such as guitar tab content and user-generated content.
   - Data Warehousing Solutions (e.g., Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery) for storing and analyzing large volumes of structured data.
   - Data Lakes (e.g., Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake Storage) for storing raw and processed data in a scalable and cost-effective manner.

3. **Data Processing and Analysis**:
   - Apache Spark for distributed data processing and analysis, especially for handling large-scale datasets.
   - Python Data Science Libraries (e.g., pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) for data manipulation, feature engineering, and machine learning.
   - Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy) for text processing and analysis of guitar tab content.
   - Recommendation Systems Libraries (e.g., Surprise, LightFM) for building and evaluating recommendation algorithms.

4. **Model Deployment and Integration**:
   - Web Frameworks (e.g., Flask, Django) for building RESTful APIs and web applications to serve recommendation results to users.
   - Containerization Platforms (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) for packaging and deploying recommendation system components in isolated environments.
   - Cloud Computing Platforms (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure) for hosting and scaling recommendation system infrastructure.
   - CI/CD Tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD) for automating the deployment and continuous integration of recommendation system updates.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Logging Frameworks (e.g., ELK Stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for collecting and analyzing logs from recommendation system components.
   - Monitoring Tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for monitoring system performance, resource utilization, and user interactions.

6. **Development and Collaboration**:
   - Version Control Systems (e.g., Git, SVN) for managing codebase changes and collaborating with team members.
   - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) (e.g., PyCharm, Visual Studio Code) for writing, testing, and debugging code.

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Personalized Recommendations** 
2. **Diverse Content Coverage**
3. **Improve Learning and Skill Development**
4. **Enhance User Experience**
5. **Community Engagement and Interaction**
6. **Feedback and Iteration**:
7. **Accessibility and Cross-Platform Compatibility (potentially)**:
